title: "Switching to Quarto from Blogdown"

1.  Create subfolder in our 'posts' folder to hold converted file. Use any name but I like the form *yyyy-mm-dd_name-of-post*.
2.  Create subfolder below the one just created called 'img'.
3.  Copy any image files from the old version over to the 'img' directory we just made.
4.  Copy old rendered HTML document (not the RMD markdown document) to the new folder.
5.  Rename copied HTML file from *\<filename\>.html* to *\<filename\>.qmd*.
6.  Load QMD file into RStudio.
7.  Search/Replace all instances of \`class="r"\` to \`class="sourceCode r"\`.
8.  Fix path names of any image files to point to the 'img' folder.
9.  Save and Render. Done!
