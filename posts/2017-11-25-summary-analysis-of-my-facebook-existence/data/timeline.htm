My frat (Kappa Sigma) had &quot;help&quot; week, instead of &quot;hell&quot; week, for the pledges, where we cleaned and fixed-up our future living quarters.  No  abuse involved.  We styled ourselves in opposition to the boorish macho posturing of some of the other houses but we paid a social cost for that.   The majority of girls wanted to hang out with the &quot;bad boys.&quot; We had a saying at the house: &quot;Get drunk, abuse women, get laid.&quot;  It wasn&#039;t an injunction. It was a lament about our frustration that bad behavior seemed to be rewarded elsewhere.

I don&#039;t want to sound like I&#039;m victim-blaming (or like a frustrated nerd.  Well, I am a nerd), but women have a lot of power and should wield it.  The culture will change when college women signal they won&#039;t put up with bad behavior.  The Zeitgeist is shifting, allowing women to go public to shame predators.  It&#039;s about time, bro.

He invited me to his club.  We arrived Friday night but were not scheduled to meet until Saturday morning.  We are in the dining room and the manager, Dave, comes up and says ‘how are you doing?

Now I don&#039;t know where you come from
I&#039;ll probably never see your face again
It really don&#039;t matter what your name is
But it&#039;s so nice to make another friend

But I don&#039;t know where you&#039;ve been
And I don&#039;t know who you&#039;ve had in
But I know you&#039;ve got exactly what I need
It don&#039;t mean too much to me
What you do or who you see
I&#039;ll be leavin&#039; here at three
So love me tonight

-------------------
Long ago and oh so far away
I fell in love with you before the second show
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
But you&#039;re not really here
It&#039;s just the radio

Don&#039;t you remember you told me you loved me baby
You said you&#039;d be coming back this way again baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby, I love you I really do

Loneliness is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait to be with you again

What to say to make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

Roosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press...He drew the line, however, at expose-oriented scandal-mongering journalists...Roosevelt himself was not usually a target, but his speech in 1906 coined the term &quot;muckraker&quot; for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges. &quot;The liar,&quot; he said, &quot;is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves.&quot;

The press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance. Ever since 1904, he had been periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the Panama Canal. In the least judicious use of executive power, according to biographer Brands, Roosevelt, near the end of his term, demanded that the Justice Department bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer&#039;s New York World. The publication had accused him of &quot;deliberate misstatements of fact&quot; in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court—it was not a federal offense, but one enforceable at the state court level. The Justice Department had predicted that result, and had also advised Roosevelt accordingly.[189]</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, February 6, 2017 at 8:47am EST</div><div class="comment">Breaking news from 1953</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, February 5, 2017 at 7:57pm EST</div>Art Steinmetz shared oWOW&#039;s photo.</p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, February 5, 2017 at 1:49pm EST</div><div class="comment">Berlin?

We do not speak against them for their nationality, but for their crimes. American traders of equal infamy, to the shame of the American name, have stocked Asiatic cities with American girls.

On the Pacific Coast eternal vigilance alone can save us from a flood of Asiaticism, with its weak womanhood, its men of scant chivalry, its polluting vices and its brothel slavery. Bubonic plague in San Francisco and Seattle was alarming. Mongolian brothel slavery, the Black Death in morals, is more alarming.

On both coasts and throughout all our cities, only an awakening of the whole Christian conscience and intelligence can save us from the importation of Parisian and Polish pollution, which is already corrupting the manhood and youth of every large city in this nation.

3. Clinton state department showed Clinton foundation list of bidders for Haiti reconstruction projects and asked it to identify &quot;Friends of Bill.&quot;  Fast-tracked their bids.
4. Hillary is being fed debate questions ahead of time by CNN and hired a child actor to deliver a rehearsed question at a town hall.
5. Johnson vetoed over 700 spending bills as Governor of New Mexico including a law to compel pet store owners to exercise their animals 2hrs/day.
6.Johnson took time off from campaigning to do a 70-mile bike ride.

Only a tiny number of people today identify as Libertarians and naturally they are the zealots.  Well, take the 0.01% most committed Dems or Reps.  They&#039;re kooks!

Now consider how many people in this country believe (1) that we should be a socially inclusive nation with rights for all and cherish our diversity and immigrant heritage?  How many people believe (2) the government can&#039;t do everything and its spending should be limited to things that only government can do AND that work, rather than things that sound like nice goodies for some group of voters (including the rich ones).  If you believe both of these things you are neither a Democrat nor a Republican.  You are a Libertarian! #JohnsonWeld</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 21, 2016 at 6:48pm EDT</div><div class="comment">Looks like fun!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, September 20, 2016 at 7:33pm EDT</div>Art Steinmetz shared Libertarian for President 2020&#039;s post.<div class="comment">There is no chance Johnson will win the popular vote, but there is a bigger-than-tiny chance he might take New Mexico and Utah.

I think the corporate tax rate should be cut.  Okay, okay. Consider the source.  Of course a privileged one-percenter would say that, but President Obama agrees with me!  Why?  Because lower corporate taxes lead to MORE jobs at HIGHER PAY for American workers.  The empirical evidence is pretty solid, which is why both sides of the aisle support it.  Simple, effective, market-based.

Now consider the commercials Hillary is running about her economic plan.  To achieve ostensibly the same result she wants to levy an exit tax on companies moving overseas and &quot;use the money&quot; for &quot;job training.&quot;

Friends, Hillary&#039;s plan is harmful and cynical.  First, jobs are better than job training. Duh. This doesn&#039;t create ANY jobs. Second, it does create yet another government middle man with incentives to throw sand in the gears and slow growth.  Third, this deliberately bad policy is out there because noises about punishment get more votes talking than about good policy.

Still this is a fun quiz site, and all my Facebook friends seem to like quizzes.  The quiz is worth taking because we all like to simplify decision-making and too often that means picking just one issue, say, abortion, and choose a candidate who most aligns with your view on that.  Or, one candidate says something stupid and we cover our ears thereafter.  This quiz might make you think just a little bit more deeply about what matters to you in what is a pretty important decision.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 10:23am EDT</div>Art Steinmetz shared Died Laughing&#039;s photo.<div class="comment">Cute</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 1, 2016 at 5:32pm EDT</div>Art Steinmetz is with Carrie Steinmetz.<div class="comment">I guess the lessons paid off.

I was struck by two phases of American turmoil, the depression of the 1930&#039;s and the Vietnam era.  Artists in both era&#039;s were enraged by what they saw around them.  I have to say though, the art of the 60s/70s was &quot;pop art&quot; as opposed to the &quot;serious painting&quot; of the 30&#039;s.  The art of the 30&#039;s moved me more because it felt like the artists put more effort into their work and therefore had higher conviction in their message.  A retrograde view, perhaps.

I am thrilled that one of the books that stirred me most as an adolescent is, just this month, available as an ebook. It is rooted in its time and place (late 60s America) and how it looked to the author (a gay black man) yet endures as one of best American novels ever written ( say the folks who opine on such matters).  As a kid I said &quot;there must be some shit going on I don&#039;t know about.&quot;  

Is the first line &quot;wooned&quot; or &quot;wowned.&quot;  It&#039;s both.

No. Rather:

The band will love you ’cause they get to record an album – that’s all they’ve ever wanted to do all their lives. You tell your band, ‘OK you’ve got to get it done in four or five days,’ and you get the album done. So you’ve got your six albums done for under 20,000 dollars, whatever. You’ve just made yourself 80,000 dollars.

You, my 50-something facebook friend, probably have cancer. Or, rather, if you go looking for something, chances are better than 50% you will find something. As the chart below shows, what you should do about it is probably nothing. My doctor was a co-author of the &quot;gold standard&quot; of renal cancer treatment.  &quot;cut first, ask questions later&quot; is the cliff notes version.

Now we get to the point of the story. My miserable post-op led me to some second guessing but what I found shocked me. For many cancers, EARLY DETECTION IS BUNK. It does not save lives. The chart below tells two stories.  In 1975 50% of all kidney cancer diagnoses led to death. Now just 25% do. Is that a triumph of medicine? No. Kidney cancer deaths per 1000 are roughly unchanged. Diagnosis have soared, however. This is entirely due to &quot;incidentalomas.&quot; we can assume that diagnosis leads to intervention. But all those interventions have not reduced the death rate at all!  What they have done is created cost, cascading interventions (as in my case) and complications.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, March 4, 2012 at 12:50pm EST</div><div class="comment">Overdiagnosis pt. 4.

I wind up carrying around a surgical drain for five months.  Going through an airport body scanner with drain bulb sticking out is awkward, I must say.  Finally, the kidney seals itself.  Now a YEAR LATER, I am fine but in pain from the scar and not fit for a bathing suit.  Question is: was it necessary?  Yes, it was a malignant cancer but so what?

So, when I get done freaking out I consult with several surgeons who all say &quot;cut.&quot;  I settled on one guy who literally wrote the book on treatment protocols.  He did say that 20% of such tumors are benign but this one didn&#039;t look that way although he couldn&#039;t be sure.  After removal, there is only a 5% chance of recurrence, he said.  So I went under the knife last November. Turns out, the tumor was malignant.  The surgery went fine and three days later I went home home.  Unfortunately, 3 days after that I was calling 911.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, February 29, 2012 at 7:21pm EST</div><div class="comment">More on &quot;Overdiagnosis.&quot;  Since most of my facebook friends are of a certain age it might be useful hear my experience because I would do it differently next time.  It&#039;s not one with a bad outcome but I will never know what the counterfactual is.  18 months ago I went in for my 50yr colonoscopy.  It was fine.  Coincidentally, I had cramps a few days earlier and when I mentioned it to the doctor he suggested a CT scan.  Nothing showed up as the likely cause of my cramps but they found a 2.5cm &quot;renal mass suggestive of malignancy.&quot;  I had what doctors jokingly call an incidentaloma.  Something that shows up when looking for something else, though there aren&#039;t any symptoms.  Uh, oh.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, February 29, 2012 at 7:27am EST</div><div class="comment">Ignorance of a condition may be healthier. I had part of a kidney removed a year ago.

You know how sometimes you hear a song on the radio, love it, but don&#039;t find out what it is?  I don&#039;t listen to commercial radio often so it&#039;s possible for me to completely miss a hit song.  I heard a song at the gym, twice, and loved it but never got the name.  Then, this morning I heard it on Radio Paradise and the name scrolls across the display.  Great, but the real amazing thing is I have been trying to find the song for 10 years!  I heard it in 1998 and I figured it was gone forever even as the occasional riff from it came popping back into my head.   It been one of those things that is slowly receeding from my memory. This moring I knew it was it after the first bar.  You could have knocked me over with a feather.

Like I said. you had to be there.  So here is the video.&quot; Precious Little&quot; by Eleanor McEvoy.  It&#039;s fluffy pop.
